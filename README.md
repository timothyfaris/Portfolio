My academic and professional careers have been built around photography. This passion started during my undergraduate years, when I studied photography and architectural design. These two areas of focus provided me with the foundational understanding to build my own practice. I hold an MFA in Visual Art with an emphasis in Photography.

Along with my degrees, I have had varied teaching opportunities that have provided me with a broad range of skill sets in analog and digital photography, various printing techniques, and collaborative design. I think it is important to highlight my role as instructor at the collegiate level. There is a lot of responsibility involved in designing and leading professional courses. I get to work with some incredibly talented artists, and itâ€™s my job to provide them with constructive feedback on how they might better their work.

I now have four years of teaching experience in photography. Courses include, Digital Imaging, Black and White film photography and printing, color film development, and many alternative/experimental process techniques, including Tricolor Gum Dichromate (although, the cyanotype process is my favorite). 

I now teach a course at Indiana University called Intro to Computer Imagery. This course involves entry-level coding awareness, intermediate photo manipulation techniques, and 3D rendering. I also act as the 2D facilities technician at University of San Diego.

Creative coding has become a major outlet for my creativity and I have been attempting to make my own slide animations/transitions. Here is a brief example utilizing a single image.

 Photography remains one of my greatest passions and I have been working on an auto color balance app in my own time, [processing-greyShift](https://github.com/timothyfaris/processing-greyShift), which is being developed in Processing. I know that my background in chemical printing techniques has helped provide some pretty specific insights when working on imaging software, and Processing has been a great way for me to start transitioning an understanding of visual art into code.
