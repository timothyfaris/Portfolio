# Portfolio
My academic and professional careers have revolved around photography, a passion that began during my undergraduate years while studying photography and architectural design. This combination provided the foundation for my own practice, leading to an MFA in Visual Art with an emphasis in Photography.

I have since had various teaching appointments, equipping me with a broad skill set in both film and digital photography, historic and contemporary printing techniques, and maybe most importantly, collaborative design. As a collegiate instructor, I design and lead professional courses. I work with talented artists and it is my responsibility to provide constructive feedback and help them enhance their work.

I graduated with my MFA in 2019 and have been teaching ever since (with a slight lapse during the pandemic of 2020). Courses that I have taught include, Advanced Digital Photography, Black and White Darkroom, Color Film Development, and Alternative Processes.

One of my favorite courses to teach was online for Indiana University and called Intro to Computer Imagery. This course involved entry-level coding, photo editing, and 3D rendering.

This image shows the interior of a pinhole camera modeled in Blender (this view is looking into the camera from the perspective of the lens). The circles of light are projections created by the pinhole lens rendered in EEVEE.

Creative coding and generative art was another facet of my Computer Imaging course. This style of artmaking has become a major creative outlet for me, and I now use coding as a means to turn some of my still images into animations.

Most recently I served as the 2D Facilities Assistant at the University of San Diego. Within this role I worked directly with students and faculty to streamline the creative and learning processes. My responsibilities included the functional maintenance of all department facilities, including the chemical darkroom, large format print lab, woodworking studio, metalworking studio, laser engravers, and computer labs. I was also responsible for organizing and maintaining a physical inventory of over 300 items for the department's Audio/Visual rental system - mainly photography and videography equipment.

In my spare time, I've been developing an auto color balance app, [processing-greyShift](https://github.com/timothyfaris/processing-greyShift), using the Processing Development Environment. My background in chemical printing techniques has provided unique insights into imaging software, and Processing has been an excellent tool for transitioning my understanding of visual art into code.
