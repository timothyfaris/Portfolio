My academic and professional paths have centered around photography, a passion that began during my undergraduate studies in photography and architectural design. This combination provided the foundation for my own practice, leading to an MFA in Visual Art with an emphasis on Photography.

I have since had diverse teaching opportunities, equipping me with a broad skill set in both analog and digital photography, various printing techniques, and collaborative design. As a collegiate instructor, I design and lead professional courses, working with talented artists to provide constructive feedback and help them enhance their work.

I have about five years of teaching experience in photography. Courses taught include Digital Imaging, Black and White Film Photography and Printing, Color Film Development and Printing, and Experimental Processes. This last course covers alternative printing processes such as Salt Printing, Tricolor Gum Dichromate, and Cyanotype.

Currently, I teach a course at Indiana University called Intro to Computer Imagery, which covers entry-level coding, intermediate photo manipulation techniques, and 3D rendering. Additionally, I serve as the 2D facilities technician at the University of San Diego.

Creative coding has become a major outlet. I have started to combine my photographs into slideshows with custom slide transitions.

Photography remains one of my greatest interests. In my spare time, I've been developing an auto color balance app, processing-greyShift, using Processing. My background in chemical printing techniques has provided unique insights into imaging software, and Processing has been an excellent tool for transitioning my understanding of visual art into code.
