# Portfolio
My academic and professional careers have revolved around photography, a passion that began during my undergraduate years while studying photography and architectural design. This combination provided the foundation for my own practice, leading to an MFA in Visual Art with an emphasis in Photography.

I have since had various teaching appointments, equipping me with a broad skill set in both film and digital photography, historic and contemporary printing techniques, and collaborative design. As a collegiate instructor, I design and lead professional courses. I work with talented artists and it is my responsibility to provide constructive feedback and help them enhance their work.

I graduated with my MFA in 2019 and have been teaching ever since (with a slight lapse during the pandemic of 2020). Courses that I have taught include, Digital Photography, Black and White Darkroom Photography and Printing, Color Film Development and Printing, and Experimental Processes. This last course covers alternative printing processes such as Salt Printing, Tricolor Gum Printing, and the Cyanotype process.

<!-- I currently teach a course at Indiana University called Intro to Computer Imagery that involves entry-level coding, intermediate photo manipulation techniques, and 3D rendering. Additionally, I serve as the 2D facilities technician at the University of San Diego. -->

Creative coding has become a major outlet for me. I have started to combine my photographs into slideshows with custom slide transitions.

In my spare time, I've been developing an auto color balance app, [processing-greyShift](https://github.com/timothyfaris/processing-greyShift), using the Processing Development Environment. My background in chemical printing techniques has provided unique insights into imaging software, and Processing has been an excellent tool for transitioning my understanding of visual art into code.
