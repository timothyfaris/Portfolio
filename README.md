# Portfolio
My academic and professional careers have been built around photography. This passion started during my undergraduate years, when I studied photography and architectural design. These two areas of focus provided me with the foundational understanding to build my own practice. I eventually decided to go back for my MFA in Visual Art with an emphasis in Photography.

I now have four years of teaching experience in photography. Courses include, Digital Imaging, Black and White film photography and printing, color film development, and many alternative process techniques, including Gum Bichromate. Most recently, I have taken on teaching a course in Computer Imagery. This course involves entry-level coding awareness, intermediate photo manipulation techniques, and 3D rendering.

My degrees and varied teaching opportunities have provided me with a broad range of skill sets in analog and digital photography, various printing techniques, and collaborative design. I think it is important to highlight my role as instructor at the collegiate level. There is a lot of responsibility involved in designing and leading professional courses. I get to work with some incredibly talented artists, and itâ€™s my job to provide them with constructive feedback on how they might better their work.
